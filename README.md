## 📈 Analytics & Event Tracking

Comprehensive game analytics with localStorage persistence to track user engagement:

### Tracked Events

1. **`play_game`** - Tracks each game play instance
   - Parameters: `game_name`, `timestamp`
   - Example: `play_game({ game_name: "Crossy Road", timestamp: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z" })`

2. **`game_played_total`** - Tracks cumulative play count per user
   - Parameters: `game_name`, `play_count`, `first_played`, `last_played`
   - Example: `game_played_total({ game_name: "Traffic Run", play_count: 10, first_played: "2025-01-10T08:00:00Z", last_played: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z" })`

3. **`game_card_click`** - Game card clicks on the home page
4. **`game_play_click`** - Play button clicks
5. **`share_button_click`** - Share button clicks
6. **`copy_link_click`** - Copy link actions
7. **`social_share_click`** - Social media shares
8. **`github_link_click`** - GitHub repository link clicks

### Analytics Implementation

The analytics system uses **localStorage** to persist play counts per user (not per session):

```typescript
// src/lib/analytics.ts
export interface GameStats {
  [gameName: string]: {
    playCount: number;      // Total plays by this user
    lastPlayed: string;     // ISO timestamp of last play
    firstPlayed: string;    // ISO timestamp of first play
  };
}

// Track when a game is played
trackGamePlayed('Crossy Road');

// Get play count for a specific game
const count = getGamePlayCount('Traffic Run'); // Returns: 10

// Get total play count across all games
const total = getTotalPlayCount(); // Returns: 47

// Get most played game
const mostPlayed = getMostPlayedGame(); // Returns: { name: "Crossy Road", count: 23 }
```

### Storage Format

Game statistics are stored in localStorage under the key `playful_game_stats`:

```json
{
  "Crossy Road": {
    "playCount": 23,
    "lastPlayed": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "firstPlayed": "2025-01-10T08:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "Traffic Run": {
    "playCount": 10,
    "lastPlayed": "2025-01-15T09:15:00.000Z",
    "firstPlayed": "2025-01-12T14:20:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Support

Global type declarations in `src/types/global.d.ts`:

```typescript
declare global {
  interface Window {
    trackEvent?: (eventName: string, parameters?: Record<string, unknown>) => void;
  }
}
```

### Analytics Setup

- **Google Analytics 4**: Event tracking with custom parameters
- **GTM (Google Tag Manager)**: Tag management for analytics
- **localStorage**: Persistent play count tracking per user
- **Event Parameters**: Rich metadata including timestamps, play counts, and game names
